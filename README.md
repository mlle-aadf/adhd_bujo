TLDR: Web-dev diploma final project. A simple CRUD app for task & event management, currently for mobile only.

Concept: <br/>
  A virtual [bullet journal](https://bulletjournal.com/) tailored to people with ADHD (or anyone who likes planning simplified)<br/>

Design: <br/>
  Minimal, intuitive UI. No fluff, just the important stuff! <br/>

Home page;
  displays current date, which also serves as navigation to daily, monthly or yearly views
  square (checkbox icon) redirects to ToDo page, pencil to Notes page
  smiley 'hello' at the bottom primes user to refer to a friendly helper (which will redirect home on all other pages)

Navigation;
  day number redirects to the daily view 
  month name redirects to the monthly view 
  year number redirects to the yearly view 

Daily view: icons expand/collapse sections, some headers (To-Do and Notes) redirect to corresponding pages
  priorities - top 3 tasks marked most important and urgent ([Eisenhower Matrix](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/your-way-adhd/202110/learning-prioritize-adhd))
  schedule - quick glance of the day's events
  to-do - create a new task (importance and urgency must be specified) and preview task list. 
  notes - jot down a quick note (or the genius idea that just popped into your brain)

Monthly & Yearly views
  calendar(s), with corresponding events listed. create new events in Monthly view ("+" icon)

To-Do page: 
  priorities, to-do - same as in daily view
  completed - see completed tasks for that dopamine boost!
  deleted - in case you didn't mean to delete the task, or changed your mind

Notes page:
  create new notes, see all notes

Smiley friend:
  takes you back home!
