TLDR: <br/>
  Web-dev diploma final project. A simple CRUD app for task & event management, currently for mobile only.

Concept: <br/>
  A virtual [bullet journal](https://bulletjournal.com/) tailored to people with ADHD (or anyone who likes planning simplified)<br/>

Design: <br/>
  Minimal, intuitive UI. No fluff, just the important stuff! <br/>

Home page;<br/>
  - displays current date, which also serves as navigation to daily, monthly or yearly views<br/>
  - square (checkbox icon) redirects to ToDo page, pencil to Notes page<br/>
  - smiley 'hello' at the bottom primes user to refer to a friendly helper (which will redirect home on all other pages)<br/>

Navigation;<br/>
  - day number redirects to the daily view <br/>
  - month name redirects to the monthly view <br/>
  - year number redirects to the yearly view <br/>

Daily view: icons expand/collapse sections, some headers (To-Do and Notes) redirect to corresponding pages<br/>
  - priorities - top 3 tasks marked most important and urgent ([Eisenhower Matrix](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/your-way-adhd/202110/learning-prioritize-adhd)) <br/>
  - schedule - quick glance of the day's events <br/>
  - to-do - create a new task (importance and urgency must be specified) and preview task list. <br/>
  - notes - jot down a quick note (or the genius idea that just popped into your brain)<br/>

Monthly & Yearly views<br/>
  - calendar(s), with corresponding events listed. create new events in Monthly view ("+" icon)<br/>

To-Do page: <br/>
  - priorities, to-do - same as in daily view<br/>
  - completed - see completed tasks for that dopamine boost!<br/>
  - deleted - in case you didn't mean to delete the task, or changed your mind<br/>

Notes page:<br/>
  - create new notes, see all notes<br/>

Smiley friend:<br/>
  - takes you back home!<br/>
